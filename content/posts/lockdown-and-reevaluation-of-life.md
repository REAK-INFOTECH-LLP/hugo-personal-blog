Lockdown has to got to be the most interesting time of our lives. Atleast for me I never
imagined living this way, it has always been a dream of mine to buy a huge area of land
close to a river and just pass my days in the arms of nature doing life's basic chores but never
thought this would come to life ever.

Queue in the pandemic and I'm living the life except I ain't super rich and owner of a large
estate but what I have isn't shabby either. 
The pandemic kicked-off with stress and anxiety for me, I was super stressed about my business,
my life how everything would be kicked upside down. How would my company be keeping up with
expenses with every client pausing everything that was going on.


But slowly and surely everything came back on track, or atleast for me since I started looking
at a usually overlooked aspect of life. **Peace.**


Pandemic showed our ugly side, How modern economies are built on useless consumerism or how the
most important essential section of the society is the most underpaid or how clueless the
fucking governments are and how mismanaged our systems actually are.


But on the flip side, on a more positive note it brought us back to our roots. Spending time with
your family and loved ones introduced a whole new dynamic which got lost somewhere in the
recent years. Shown us what the actual work life balance means and how it's so important
to have time on your hands. How there is a life ahead of modern gadgets, how interesting
real conversations with your friends and family are.

How amazing it is to come up with a recipe, or cook something yourself rather than tapping
soullessly on your phone to order food,
How interesting it is to read a book outside in the middle of the day, Doing things together
as a family.


I guess it's kind of nature's way of balancing things, bring us back to realize what we lost all
along and expecting us to improve the next time we start again.
