Oh damn !, It's been ages and I'm ashamed to say that I forgot about my little corner of the internet ...

<!--more-->

Life happened .., I use this phrase a lot and it's time I should stop using it for the best.

That's my goto response for not checking up my college friends, it's my goto for my distant family
and if you ask me about my blog and why there are no posts after mid-2021 I would reiterate the same
phrase again.

But indeed life happened if I am being totally honest, chasing after profits ... doubling headcounts
and tripling sales was the only thing I was focussed on.

But it wasn't all work and no play, your's truly is now a very proud tennis player and it's pretty
okay for someone who picked it up about 12 months ago.

Now that I have gone through the usual cycle I return humbly to my little corner and hopefully will
stick with it for the foreseeable future.

My BSNL Wings post gained a lot of traction and that gives me motivation to share projects like
these to the general public, I have zero clue on how people found out that blog post with my shitty
ass SEO techniques but glad it happened.

I am happy to report that we would be launching a low-cost pbx system for India which would be
targetted towards small and medium businesses and companies improving their telephony system and
making it easy to provide easy access for their users to connect with their team. So be on the
watchout for that, in the meantime I'll make sure to keep this updated.

Also head out to https://reak.in/blog for more content of the same nature.

Peace Out X.
