I'm Ashish Saxena, a 27 (soon to be 28) year old bloke who is still figuring life out and on probably hope that I'm on the right path to build my own successful business.

I own and run REAK Infotech LLP, It's a small Software Development and Technical Consultancy Company. I started building software for small businesses and startups in 2nd year of my undergraduate program and it snowballed from there. I've always been interested in technology which amplified my love for programming, I absolutely adore the problem solving aspect of programming.

I have worked with a number of technologies and frameworks, and always open to learn and explore more.
My absolutely favourite programming languages would have to be
* C++ , It's a beast in the hands of a right developer, Light & Superfast. Pair it with Qt and Boost and it's like development on steroids be it mobile apps, cross platform desktop apps, High performance web apps it covers everything
* Python, Best language to hack in. An infinite pool of amazing packages / libraries which can get weekend projects done in a month !. Easy access to Machine Learning is another reason why I love Python
* Go, My goto for a pure web based application or simple projects. I used to use python but the progress done in Go project makes it very lucrative. The website you're currently reading is powered by Go (Hugo)

I work with other languages too, these would be Javascript / Typescript / NativeScript, PHP, Ruby, Rust. I am not a big fan of Java to be very honest. The framework always felt bloated and got amplified when I used both iOS and Android. Although Kotlin and Scala have peaked my interest with Java (or atleast the JVM) again.

When I am not working, I would still be around my desk either tinkering with electronic components (I absolutely love the ESP series) building something hacky that can probably make my life a bit easier or working on a small weekend project that might get completed in a couple of months or be lost in abyss forever.
I also love gaming, and would usually be found "relaxing" after work with a competitive match on CSGO or trying to beat lap records on sim racing. 

Not a big fan of social media, which drove me to create this website to get a quiet corner on the internet where only legitimate seekers could find me.
